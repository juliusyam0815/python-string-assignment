# Python String Assignment

## ðŸ“– Description
This program allows the user to input a sentence and perform various string operations from a menu.  
The available operations include:
1. Reverse the sentence  
2. Count vowels  
3. Check if palindrome  
4. Find and replace a word  
5. Format (title case)  
6. Split into words  
7. Word frequency counter  
8. Swap case  
9. Exit  

The menu keeps repeating until the user chooses to exit.

While solving this assignment, I learned how to:
- Use loops and conditionals to keep a program running until exit.
- Work with string methods such as `.title()`, `.replace()`, `.swapcase()`, etc.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
- Organize code into functions for readability and reusability.

Overall, this assignment helped me strengthen my understanding of **string manipulation** in Python.
