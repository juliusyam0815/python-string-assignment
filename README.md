# Python String Assignment

## ðŸ“– Description
This program allows the user to input a sentence and perform various string operations from a menu.  
The available operations include:
1. Reverse the sentence  
2. Count vowels  
3. Check if palindrome  
4. Find and replace a word  
5. Format (title case)

The menu keeps repeating until the user chooses to exit.

While solving this assignment, I learned how to:
- Use loops and conditionals to keep a program running until exit.
- Work with string methods such as `.title()`, `.replace()`, `.swapcase()`, etc.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
- Organize code into functions for readability and reusability.

Overall, this assignment helped me strengthen my understanding of **string manipulation** in Python.
